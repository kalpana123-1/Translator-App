# Translator-App

Simple translation applicaion by fetching an API.


Simple translation application by fetching a translating API. Where the user can translate into 16 different languages around the world. I also provided use speech to text as well as read this to make the website more useful. Implemented by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


![My app](https://github.com/kalpana123-1/Translator-App/blob/main/picture.png "Translation App")

When we wanted to translate a language from one to anther can easily use this app to figure it out. It was very to understand the flow of the website like it was having two placeholders, one is for entering the text after selecting the text which you wanted to translate. Then you have to select the language for which you need to convert. 

It will be helpful for users who wanted to learn english. As I created with very simple logic given me the experience of How to understand the working with API's and how to get the data from the API's is given the inspiration to undertand it with much clear concepts.
